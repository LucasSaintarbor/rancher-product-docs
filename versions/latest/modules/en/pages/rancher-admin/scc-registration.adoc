:page-revdate: {revdate}

Since Rancher v2.12.1, you should now register your SUSE Rancher Manager Prime Suite with https://scc.suse.com/home[SUSE Customer Center (SCC)] from the Rancher UI. This will enable you to see your registered systems in SCC under your subscription.

== Prequsities

Registering your Rancher Manager instance with SUSE Customer Center requires a SUSE account. If you don't have a SUSE account yet, visit the https://scc.suse.com/[SCC home page] to create one.

You must also have access to your organization. To join your organization, you may either:

* Ask your organization's administrator to add you to the account. See our https://scc.suse.com/docs/userguide#UG-Requesting-Access-to-an-Organizations-Account[documentation] for details.
* If you know one of your organization's registration codes, enter it when prompted.
