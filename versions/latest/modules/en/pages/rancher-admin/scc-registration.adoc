:revdate: 2025-08-19
:page-revdate: {revdate}

Since Rancher v2.12.1, you should now register your SUSE Rancher Manager Prime Suite with https://scc.suse.com/home[SUSE Customer Center (SCC)] from the Rancher UI or through Helm. This enables you to see your registered systems in SCC under your subscription. 

== Prequsities

* Registering your Rancher Manager instance with SCC requires a SUSE account. If you don't have a SUSE account yet, [create one](https://www.suse.com/account/create/).

* You must have access to your organization. Ask your organization's administrator to add you to the account. See the https://scc.suse.com/docs/userguide#UG-Requesting-Access-to-an-Organizations-Account[SCC documentation] for details. If you know your organization's registration code, enter it when prompted.

== Register with SUSE Customer Center

From the Rancher UI, go to *Global Settings* > *Registration*. You can also check the Notification Center (bell icon) in the upper-right corner for a "Rancher Prime Registration" notification and click *Register Now*. This redirects you to the *Registration* page under *Global Settings*.

You have the option to register your Rancher Manager instance with SCC <<Online Registration,online>> or <<Offline Registration,offline>>.

=== Online Registration

You can register online through the Rancher UI or with Helm.

Before proceeding, you must have the registration code for your Rancher Manager subscription on SCC. To get the registration code:
. Log in to SCC.
. Navigate to **My Organizations** and click on the organization with your Rancher Manager subscription.
. Find your Registration code under *Organization* > *Subscriptions* > *Subscription Information*.

==== Rancher UI

. From the Rancher UI, copy the registration code into the *Registration code* field and click *Register*. If successful, the *Status* becomes *Active*, and the *Product Name*, *Expiration date* and *Registration mode* are displayed.

==== Helm

After you have your registration code, you can register your Rancher Prime system through Helm by passing the argument `--set registration.enabled=true --set registration.regCode=<REGISTRATION-CODE-FROM_SCC>` in the Helm install command `helm install rancher rancher-prime/rancher`.

You can also update `values.yaml`,  enabling registration and adding your registration code.
