In a lot of enterprise environments, servers or VMs running on premise do not have direct Internet access, but must connect to external services through a HTTP(S) proxy for security reasons. This tutorial shows step by step how to set up a highly available Rancher installation in such an environment.

Alternatively, it is also possible to set up Rancher completely air-gapped without any Internet access. This process is described in detail in the xref:installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/air-gapped/air-gapped.adoc[Rancher docs].
